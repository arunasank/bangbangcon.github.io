**_Creating an Arabic Programming Language!_**

Inspired by Ramsey Nasser's Arabic programming language [Qalb](http://nas.sr/%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A8/), a functional, Lisp-style language, I created Noor, an Algol-based, imperative Arabic programming language. Arabic is my first language, and I wouldn't have learned to program had I not moved to the US and learned English. I created Noor with the intention of it being a language for middle schoolers and high schoolers. In this talk I'll share what I learned about creating an Arabic programming language and how Arabic text really works on your computer.

**Ahmed** loves riding his bike all around NYC, watching the sunset from the Hudson River Park, and reading great code he wishes he wrote.

**_Evil Twins and the Secret Lives of Linkers!_**

How can code that never runs still cause a program to crash? What does it mean to link a library into a compiled program? To answer these questions (and shed some light on the mysterious dark art of linking), we'll methodically unravel a surprising edge case of static linking in a C++ program.

**Josh Bowman-Matthews** builds web browsers and communities for a living. He enjoys demolishing barriers to participation in open source projects. He also sings in a barbershop quartet.

**_Telling stories with traceroute!_**

Traceroute is a useful tool for debugging connectivity problems, but have you ever thought of it as a storytelling medium? It can be!

In this talk, I'll explain how routing and traceroute work, and then we'll use those mechanisms creatively to tell our own human-readable story in the path our packets take to a machine. Even better, we'll do it with software in the consumer cloud --  no commercial routing gear or fancy network config needed!

**Karla**'s background is in security, and her day job is making Stripe secure for users. In her spare time she tinkers with networking or security puzzles, flies planes, and learns Australian Sign Language.

### John Feminella

**_Relativistic Software Calendars: It's About Time!_**

If you thought getting datetimes and daylight savings correct was tough, wait 'til you see what relativistic time looks like! In this talk, I'll show you how keeping clocks in sync becomes literally impossible as soon as you start accelerating away from Earth, and what trying to account for this case might mean if we want our current implementations of datetime libraries to work correctly.

**John Feminella** is an avid technologist, occasional public speaker, and curiosity advocate. He serves as an advisor to Pivotal, where he works on helping enterprises transform the way they write, operate, and deploy software. He's also the cofounder of a tiny analytics monitoring and reporting project named UpHex.  John lives in Charlottesville, VA and likes meta-jokes, milkshakes, and referring to himself in the third person in speaker bios.

**_Step by Step: Algorithms that teach you math!_**

Most computer algebra systems are good at solving equations, but aren't very good at showing their work. If we're looking to educate students and automatically explain a problem intuitively, how does our approach to developing these systems have to change?

Let's talk about mathsteps, an open-source library that solves basic algebra problems and not only provides the answer, but shows you the steps that get you there. Some algorithms are designed to optimize for space or speed, but I'll talk about how we design algorithms to optimize for teaching -- algorithms that explain to you what you're doing and why.

We'll walk through the process of how both a human brain and an algorithm solve algebra problems -- from parsing math input, to using data structures that make teaching easier, to deciding which solving steps are most intuitive to apply first and how to group them together. Finally, we'll talk about the future of tools like mathsteps -- possibilities as well as limitations.

**Evy** loves to sing (especially in choirs) and code (especially for social good). She loves her communities.

**_Talking to my past self (without introducing temporal paradoxes!)_**

I've always wanted to have conversations with past versions of myself, but I worried about the dangerous side effects of using time machines. With the emergence of deep learning and the seq2seq model, a new solution is available!

Using chat logs I've archived since early high school, I've trained one chat bot on messages from my teenage years, and paired it up with a bot trained on more recent messages. Hilarity will ensue as I algorithmically converse with a version of myself that's younger, has significantly worse taste in music, and holds quirky political beliefs. We'll also learn how easy it is to get started with machine learning, TensorFlow, and seq2seq!

**Andrew** is a software developer from Toronto. He's currently working on building a Memex. Previously, he was the co-founder and CTO of ShopLocket, an ecommerce startup acquired in 2014.

**_How (and why) your CPU re-orders instructions!_**

Your CPU can re-order instructions as it pleases, allowing it to execute instructions in a totally different order than the order your compiler produced! This used to be an implementation detail that only compiler writers and low-level performance folks paid attention to, but it turns out that instruction re-ordering can be exploited to extract secret information!

I'll explain how out-of-order execution works and why it's beneficial, and then briefly describe how this can lead to attacks like Meltdown and Spectre. This talk assumes no background, other than the knowledge that code can somehow turn into instructions that then run on CPUs.

**Dan** is a hardware engineer masquerading as a software engineer!

**_Satellites are talking to us! Let's hear them out!_**

Over 1,500 human-made satellites are currently orbiting the Earth, and most of them are quite chatty! You might immediately think about the ones we use daily -- for TV, GPS, or the internet -- but there are hundreds of much smaller and lesser-known satellites that are just as deserving of our attention and love!

Let's hear what they have to say! We'll build an antenna out of spare coat hangers and use it to listen to the tiny amateur satellites telling stories about the world around us, playing music, delivering messages, or even speaking in lovely robotic voices!

**Ed** loves to teach other people things about stuff! By day he writes code, organizes tech conferences, and mentors communities such as Women Techmakers Berlin, and by night he spends countless hours on Blacklight, an alternate reality game for aspiring hackers.

**_The joys of PICO-8 token crunching!! Or: what I learned about programming from being restricted on every side!_**

Making games is hard. Making games when there are hard limits on the number of sprites, sound effects, colors, bars of music, and even LINES OF CODE you have at your disposal is...well...sorta mind-bending, actually. Because weird things happen when you bump up against those restrictions: you start to uncover secret trade-offs between those limited resources. Would I rather my tasty mushroom sprite have red spots, or would I prefer to be able to save high scores? How many notes in a song is a for-loop worth?

Come and learn about the beautiful Bizarro World that is fantasy console game development! And maybe, just maybe...you'll take away some insights on programming in general.

**Ayla Myers** is an independent game designer, developer, pixel artist, and fantasy console enthusiast! She spends her time crafting beauty out of code (and skating around the city when it's sunny).

**_Whoa, pictures! A visual history of visual programming languages!_**

I spend my days typing out code in a text editor. But why do words and text get to have all the fun, if under the hood itâ€™s just zeros and ones? This is a talk about some of the *other* fun, quirky, beautiful ways we could tell the computer how to do our bidding, from visual expressions of logic and spatial arrangements of symbols to manipulating physical objects in the real world. 

I'll start with a visual history of some of the major visual programming languages, with lots of pictures. Then we'll talk through the ins and outs of some of the hairiest problems for visual languages, like how to do control flow and how to have abstraction and code reuse. Finally, we'll talk about what it all means. What problems can visual programming solve better than any other paradigm? And are any of these super-creative visual idioms and ideas things we can pull back into our text-based programming worlds?

**Emily** manages the product engineering team at Honeycomb.io.  In her free time she organizes an unconference called AndConf, makes many checklists, volunteers on trail crews, and likes to talk about disaster preparedness.

**_UX for Cats and Dogs!_**

David Burge described the internet as a worldwide cat picture distribution system. But humans had had to do all the work of *taking* those pictures ahead of time! I wanted to empower my three cats and one dog to take their own selfies, but how do you design for cats and dogs?

I will describe how I built a home photo booth from a Raspberry Pi, a camera, some motors, the Twilio API, some wood, and a ton of cat treats, to allow me to text my pets and have them send me selfies back.

If all goes well, this talk will end with a live text exchange with my pets from the stage!

**Joel Potischman** is a Brooklynite, software developer, and maybe an aspiring animal hoarder.

**_We built a map to aggregate real-time flood data in under two days!_**

During the 2015 floods in Chennai, India, a few of us built an application that could crowd-source real-time flood data.  It was used widely by at least 600,000 people in Chennai and went on to become a beautiful civic visualisation.  I'll talk about the exact workflow and tools we used to build this map, and you will take away an understanding of the libraries you can use to create your own map-driven projects.

**Aruna** is a platform engineer at Mapbox. Previously, she wrote 2D games using the Cocos2D engine and contributed to the Wikipedia, GNOME and GCompris projects. She also enjoys building communities of friendly women doing tech and collecting recordings of Indian classical music in the public domain.

**_If at first you don't succeed at beating HQ Trivia, try cheating!!_**

HQ Trivia is a game about what you know, what you can guess, and ultimately, luck. Twelve multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty make it very unlikely that anyone will win by chance alone. And the questions get really obscure and hard towards the end! So what's a player to do? Cheat!

I'll get down to the nitty-gritty about how I wrote an iOS app (and later a MacOS app) that takes advantage of Apple's Vision framework, open source OCR software, and plain ol' Google to help me decide on my answers while playing HQ Trivia. I'll also talk about why I haven't won a single time (though I've gotten close), and why some problems are just really hard for software to solve.

**Hung** has been hacking on iOS since before the original iPhone OS 2.1 SDK was released in 2008. He is currently an iOS Engineer at Lyft. His hobbies include enjoying coffee, photography, and being the social media manager and growth hacker for his dog, Sodapop.

**_Compressing the Library of Babel!_**

How do you compress the set of all possible books?  What can we learn about data compression by trying to do this?  We'll cover zip bombs, the pigeon-hole principle, Kolmogorov complexity, and the Hutter Prize, all compressed into a ten-minute talk.

**David Turner** hacks on git at Two Sigma. He previously co-founded OpenTripPlanner, and worked on version 3 of the GPL. He enjoys contributing patches to random projects, like Inkscape and Linux. He lives on Mars with his glorious wife and three pet tigers. He spoke at !!Con in 2014 and 2017.

**_Pseudofractals! Accidental aesthetics where math meets pixels_**

Computers have their own aesthetics, which come from their limitations.

In this talk, I'll show you a family of glitch art that is so fundamental to the idea of pixels that it has been independently rediscovered, repeatedly, ever since humans first starting asking machines to print drawings on paper.

Every researcher who has found these has given them a new name -- they've been called CIRCLE<sup>2</sup> algorithms, dot-matrix holograms, degenerate Voronoi patterns, and others -- but I think "pseudofractals"" is the most evocative descriptor.

I'll talk a little about the mathematics behind these patterns (the Nyquest limit! Chromogeometries!), and I'll show how you can experiment with creating your own variants in Javascript, WebGL, or the language of your choice.

**Jes Wolfe!** is a computer programmer who, in some contexts, refers to themself as an "artist" and/or "musician", and is especially interested in the aesthetic consequences of algorithms. They live in a house in the woods in Portland, Oregon, and they are currently on parental leave from GitHub.
